# FinalPrototype
The raw code for the Annotater project

Requires downloaded and set up Python 3.10 as well as the following libraries and their dependencies:
- wxPython version 4.2.1
- pdf2image version 1.17.1
- Pillow version 10.2.0

Tried to provide the executables for ubuntu and windows, but they were large and did not want to upload to github
